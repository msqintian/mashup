In this project, I called APIs from flickrs and google. The goal of this project is to grab my albums
stored in flickrs, and list all photos in each album. When I show these photos to my friends, I can 
click 'show on map' to show them where these pictures were taken. It is also nice to see the map of 
my footprints.

Currently, my credentials are hard coded. It would be nice to have an authentication function. Then
this app can be used by any one who has an account with flickrs.

# Mashup project

This project is open-ended!  Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting way.  In other words, the JS code should be **non-trivial**.  That being said... start simple!  No server-side coding is required, but feel free to create a backend in whatever language if you like, if you need one.
